# questionable-cli
## A very questionable cli indeed. Written in Go.

This is a cli written in Go with a lot of help from Cobra. I wrote it to have some practice writing in Go, and writing CLI's. 
It's public but I don't really see what use anyone else could get out of it lol. Enjoy.

Example: `qcli <command>`
