## A very questionable cli indeed. Written in Go.

This is a cli written in Go with a lot of help from Cobra. I wrote it to have some practice writing in Go, and writing CLI's. 
It's public but I don't really see what use anyone else could get out of it lol. Enjoy.

Example: `qcli <command>`

## Requirements
- golang 

## How to use

- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/mrintern/questionable-cli.git`
- Build the executable `go build`
- `go list -f '{{.Target}}'`
- `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/install/directory`
- `go install`
- `questionable-cli`
